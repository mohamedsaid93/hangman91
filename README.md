# About The Project
The aim of the project is to build a hangman game. Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. However, our hangman game is simpler than this, it is a CLI based game, and it is one player game only, at least for now!.

This project is a tutorial task/project of a DevOps course provided by AiCore. Building this game has increase my knowledge of python especiaaly in the concept of object orinted programming. Now I feel more confident to solve bigger problems and build more challengble programs, thanks to AiCore.


# Installation and usage instructions
There are 5 different python files in this repository, but to test, run or play the game, you will only need to run milestone.py file. Other python files are considered to be incomplete and cannot be used to run the games fully. There only used as tutorials to build the game in steps. Therefore, to enjoy the game, run milestone_5.py and have fun.

To run this game, download milestone_5.py and run it using any code editor software such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm or Atom. When you run the game, you wil be prompted to enter an input of one length alphabetic character at a time.


# File structure of the project
This project has 5 different python files
- milestone_2.py: This is to create  the variable for the game.
- milestone_3.py: This is to check if the guessed character is in the word.
- milestone_4.py: This is to create the game class.
- milestone_5.py: This is to putting all parts of the game togather to build it.
  

# Improvement
This hangman game is a CLI based, to make this game more fun, the game should involve using ASCII figures throughout the different phase of the game to represent the a man, rope, and amount of lives the man has before he is completly hanged. 

Also, to improve this game even further and make it more fun, this CLI  based game should be translate it into a GUI game with the use tkinter python library.
